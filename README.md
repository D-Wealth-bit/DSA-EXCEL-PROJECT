# DSA-EXCEL-PROJECT

This work is on the DSA excel project using Amazon Case Study Data

## Project Topic-Amazon Product Review 

### Project Overview

This data aims to analyse product and customer review data to generate insights that can
guide product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement.

### Tool used
- Ms Excel [Download here](www.microsoft.com)
  - For Data Collection
  - For analysis
  - For creating a report
 
### Data cleaning and preparation
- In the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparations, we perform the following;
  - What is the average discount percentage by product category?
  - How many products are listed under each category?
  - What is the total number of reviews per category?
  - Which products have the highest average ratings?
  - What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category?
  - Which products have the highest number of reviews?
  - How many products have a discount of 50% or more?
  - What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0,
    4.0, etc.)?
  - What is the total potential revenue (actual_price × rating_count) by category?
  - What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <₹200,
   ₹200–₹500, >₹500)?
  - How does the rating relate to the level of discount?
  - How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?
  - Which categories have products with the highest discounts?
  - Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined.
 
- The product category field was split into five subcategories using Excel's Text to Columns feature.
- The first four extracted categories were merged back into the main dataset and renamed for clarity.
- Analysis was primarily conducted on the main category to allow for concise and meaningful pivot table summaries.

  ### Analytical Techniques
- Excel’s IF function was used to identify products with 50% or more discount.
- COUNTIF function calculated the total count of such discounted products.
- Pivot tables and summary statistics were created to explore patterns in rating counts and discount levels.

### Interpretation

- Encourage Detailed Reviews
 -Prompt buyers to leave comprehensive reviews, especially for discounted items, to balance the perceived value and boost engagement.

- Target High-Engagement Users
 -Identify and engage customers who leave longer or more detailed reviews, as they tend to be more invested in the brand and products.

- Leverage Sentiment Trends
 -Use review content (length, tone, sentiment) to guide improvements in product descriptions, features, and customer support touchpoints.
